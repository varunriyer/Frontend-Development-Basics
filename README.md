# Frontend-Development-Basics

## Overview

This repository provides foundational practice and hands-on examples in front-end web development. It covers essential technologies including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery, along with responsive design using Bootstrap and media queries. The focus is on building interactive, user-friendly web interfaces while following good coding practices and structuring frontend projects efficiently.

## Topics Covered

### JavaScript & jQuery

- **Selectors & DOM Traversing**: Selecting and navigating HTML elements using jQuery and JavaScript.
- **Effects & Animations**: Applying transitions and animations such as fade, slide, and toggle.
- **Ajax**: Making asynchronous requests to APIs and handling dynamic content updates.
- **Chaining**: Writing compact and readable jQuery code by chaining multiple methods.
- **Data Handling**: Using `.grep()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.sort()` for array and object transformations.
- **Event Handling**: Capturing and responding to events like click, submit, mouseover, etc.
- **Data Binding**: Connecting data to the UI dynamically.
- **Form Validations**: Ensuring user input is accurate and secure through client-side validations.
- **Response Management**: Handling API responses and updating the DOM accordingly.
- **Local Storage**: Storing and retrieving data in the browser to persist user sessions or preferences.

### Core Web Technologies

- **HTML5**: Semantic tags, forms, media content, and structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling with advanced selectors, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, shadows, floats, and flexbox.
- **SASS**: Using a CSS preprocessor for variables, nesting, and modular styling.
- **JavaScript**: Core scripting for interactivity, logic, and DOM manipulation.
- **Events & Forms**: Managing user interactions and form submissions.

### Responsive & Modern UI Design

- **Bootstrap 4**: Building mobile-first, responsive layouts with ready-made components and grid systems.
- **Media Queries**: Making UI adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Vector Graphics & SVG**: Drawing and embedding scalable vector graphics for icons and illustrations.
- **Media Content**: Handling images, audio, and video elements in web pages.

### Project Structure & Best Practices

- **Organized Codebase**: Structuring files and folders for scalability and maintainability.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular code with reusable styles and scripts.
- **JSON Server (Mock API)**: Using a local mock server to simulate backend interactions for testing and development.
